Tips and technique to market your software product on your own.

Yo, developer, you can market your own software product.<br/><br/>Here are three tips:<br/>
  <ol>
    <li><b>Show off the product.</b>&nbsp; Show examples of the performance and scalability, don't just say that it's
      faster and more scalability.&nbsp; Make your product stand for something larger.&nbsp; For example, if your
      software extracts meaning from large bodies of data, you're going to need to run your product on a few million
      nodes of social media data and actually find something interesting.&nbsp; If your cool tech makes mobile devices
      more secure, you're going to need analyze mobile security statistics, probably from a feature in your product that
      aggregates anonymous data to a central server.&nbsp; In both these cases, you, the software developer, needs to
      build some software to help market your product.
    </li>
    <li><b>Meet influencers. </b>You're already talking to customers because they provide product feedback.&nbsp; You
      feel that you've done your marketing because the customers can serve as references.&nbsp; You're not done.&nbsp;
      Customers are critical, but they're just the beginning.&nbsp; You're going to need to make a list of people with a
      wider net of influence.&nbsp; These could be reporters, analysts, or bloggers.&nbsp; Pick 10 people and update the
      list frequently.&nbsp; Read what they write.&nbsp; Interact with them on Twitter.&nbsp; Send them email directly.&nbsp;
      If you don't know where to start, type in your market category into Google News.&nbsp;&nbsp; If you get more
      advanced, use a tool like <a href="http://itdatabase.com/" target="_blank">IT Database</a> to create and manage a
      list.&nbsp; If you don't have the money for IT Database or something like Cision, then use Google Docs for free.&nbsp;&nbsp;
    </li>
    <li><b>Expose yourself.&nbsp;</b> It's more comfortable to be anonymous and hide behind the company name or the
      product name.&nbsp; Sorry to put you out of your comfort zone, but in any way you can, you need to get your
      personal name out.&nbsp; People look to other people for leadership.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This means putting your
      personal opinion out on blog posts, speaking at conferences, and putting your real name to quotes.&nbsp; In an
      extreme case, you have a programming stud like Linus Torvalds putting his own name into the Linux project and then
      becoming an outstanding spokesperson for Linux.&nbsp; I'm not suggesting that you need to be Linus Torvalds or
      Steve Jobs.&nbsp;&nbsp; There are also projects that succeed with anonymous developers.&nbsp; However, a great way
      to accelerate the adoption of your software product is to make it personal and expose a bit of what you believe
      in.
    </li>
  </ol>
  <br/>I realize that not every developer has the desire or time to do marketing.&nbsp; That is completely
  understandable.&nbsp; I make my living by doing the marketing for them.&nbsp; There is definitely a shift in Silicon
  Valley with more engineers going into marketing.&nbsp;&nbsp; Give it a try.&nbsp; You might be good at it.<br/><br/>Of
  course, there are times when you need a specialized marketing team or firm.&nbsp; Silicon Valley is full of stories of
  great products that were fatally stalled by ineffective marketing.&nbsp;&nbsp; It's a big decision to delay hiring a
  marketing team and trying to do things on your own.&nbsp;&nbsp; To help with that decision, I'll include the top three
  reasons for developers to pay money for marketing:<br/>
  <ol>
    <li><b>Unable to hire developer talent</b> because potential hires have not heard of your company or the company is
      perceived as not being "hot" or in a space that will help the developers' career;
    </li>
    <li>Your team is <b>shifting the product or company focus</b> and needs to overcome an established perception.&nbsp;
      For example, your firm is perceived as a hardware company and you are shifting the product to be a hardware plus
      software platform.&nbsp;</li>
    <li>The public views another company as a competitor and that perceived <b>competitor</b>, possibly with weaker
      technology, <b>is gaining traction</b> or about to launch.
    </li>
  </ol>
